# OFGB (Oh Frick Go Back)
On April 23, 2024, Microsoft released an [update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-23-2024-kb5036980-os-builds-22621-3527-and-22631-3527-preview-5a0d6c49-e42e-4eb4-8541-33a7139281ed) for Windows 11 that added ads all across the OS, including the File Explorer, Start Menu, and more. This tool changes certain keys in the [Windows Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry) to disable those ads. It's written in C# and uses [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation).

## First things first, credits:
- [Registry keys, comments about their function](https://github.com/xM4ddy/OFGB/blob/92756276178137bb78d7c563733dde0d24f13aff/MainWindow.xaml.cs#L33) and the inspiration for this project were all from [Shawn Brink](https://www.elevenforum.com/members/brink.2/) and [his awesome script](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/disable-ads-in-windows-11.8004/).
- [A good bit of the theme used for the app](https://github.com/xM4ddy/OFGB/blob/main/dark.xaml) is from a cool project called [DarkNet](https://github.com/Aldaviva/DarkNet) by [Aldaviva](https://github.com/Aldaviva).
